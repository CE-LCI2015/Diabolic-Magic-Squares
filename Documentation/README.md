The Diabolic Magic Squares Generator generates three different squares using the SANC method.
The SANC method consists on building four different matrixes: S, A, N and C. Each of those matrixes are multiplied by a integer (1, 2, 4 or 8) in a specific order and their sum generates a Diabolic Magic Square.
